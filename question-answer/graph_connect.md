got you — here’s the mathy “why” plus a short prep checklist so you know exactly what to review before attempting it.

# What to know first (prep checklist)

* **Divisibility basics:** multiples, common divisors, gcd; “strictly greater than threshold” means `z > t`, not `≥`.
* **Graph components:** nodes are `1..n`; edge `(x,y)` exists iff they share some divisor `z>t`. Connectivity = same component.
* **Union–Find (DSU):** `find` with path compression + union by size/rank.
* **Harmonic sums:** $\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k} = \Theta(\log n)$. You’ll use this for complexity.

# The core math insight

Think of the graph as a **union of cliques indexed by divisors**:

* For **each integer $d$ with $d>t$**, consider the set
  $M_d = \{d, 2d, 3d, \dots, \lfloor n/d \rfloor d\}$.
  Every pair in $M_d$ shares the common divisor $d$ (which is > t), so in the original graph, **$M_d$ is a clique** (all-to-all connected).

* The whole graph is the union of these cliques over all $d>t$. Two cities $x,y$ are connected iff there’s a sequence of cliques whose overlaps form a path from $x$ to $y$.

**DSU construction that preserves connectivity:**
Instead of adding all edges of every clique (too many), we add a **spanning star** per clique: for each $d>t$, union $d$ with $2d,3d,\dots$. That makes all members of $M_d$ live in one DSU component (exactly as if we had added the full clique), because connectivity is about being in the same connected component, not about which specific edges we add.

Formally:

1. **Soundness (no false positives):**
   If DSU says $x$ and $y$ are connected, there’s a sequence of unions

   $$
   x \leftrightsquigarrow v_1 \leftrightsquigarrow v_2 \leftrightsquigarrow \dots \leftrightsquigarrow y
   $$

   where each step came from some divisor $d>t$ and connects two multiples of $d$. In the original graph those same steps are valid edges (they share $d>t$), so a path exists.

2. **Completeness (no false negatives):**
   If the original graph has an edge $(x,y)$ because both are multiples of some $z>t$, then in our construction we **explicitly union all multiples of $z$** (by unioning each with the hub $z$), so $x$ and $y$ end up in the same DSU set. If the original graph has a longer path $x=v_0, v_1,\dots,v_k=y$ where each adjacent pair shares some $z_i>t$, DSU includes each of those unions, hence by transitivity $x,y$ end in the same set.

> Equivalent viewpoint: you’re computing the connected components of
> $\bigcup_{d>t} K(M_d)$ where $K(S)$ is the clique on set $S$.
> DSU builds a spanning forest for that union-of-cliques graph.

# Why “primes only” is not enough

It’s tempting to union only by prime divisors $p>t$. That can **miss edges** coming from a **composite** $z>t$ whose prime factors are all $\le t$.
Example: $t=10,\ z=12$ (prime factors 2 and 3). If two cities share divisor 12, they should be adjacent, but neither 2 nor 3 is allowed (both ≤ 10). You **must** include all $d>t$, not just primes.

# A quick path example where $\gcd(a,b)\le t$ but connected

Let $t=2$, and cities $a=6,\ b=10$.

* $\gcd(6,10)=2 \le t$ ⇒ **no direct edge**.
* But 6 and 15 share 3 (>2), and 15 and 10 share 5 (>2):
  $6 \stackrel{3}{\longleftrightarrow} 15 \stackrel{5}{\longleftrightarrow} 10$.
  So $6$ and $10$ are **indirectly connected**. DSU captures this because it unions multiples of 3 together and multiples of 5 together; node 15 sits in both, bridging the components.

# Complexity math (why $O(n\log(n/t))$)

We perform unions for each $d = t+1,\dots,n$ across its multiples $2d,3d,\dots$.
The number of multiples processed for fixed $d$ is $\lfloor n/d \rfloor - 1 = \Theta(n/d)$.
So total unions:

$$
\sum_{d=t+1}^{n} \Theta\!\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)
= \Theta\!\left(n \sum_{d=t+1}^{n} \frac{1}{d}\right)
= \Theta\!\big(n (H_n - H_t)\big)
= \Theta\!\big(n \log\frac{n}{t}\big),
$$

using the harmonic number estimate $H_m = \ln m + \gamma + o(1)$.
Each union/find is amortized $O(1)$, so preprocessing is $O(n\log(n/t))$, and answering $Q$ queries is $O(Q)$.

# Tiny checklist while coding

* Loop $d$ from `threshold+1` to `n`.
* For each $d$, loop `m` in `range(2*d, n+1, d)` and `union(d, m)`.
* Early exits:

  * `threshold >= n` ⇒ all `False`
  * `threshold == 0` ⇒ all `True`
* DSU: 1-indexed arrays, path compression + union by size.
